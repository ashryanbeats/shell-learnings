# Shell commands

`cd -`: Return to the last directory.

`pwd | pbcopy`: Copy present working directory to clipboard.

`echo "some text" >> filename`: Add a new line to a file. [`sed`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) can do this as well (see [this Stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4640152/4461425)).
